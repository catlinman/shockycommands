Scripts for use with the Shocky IRC bot.

## Origin ##

The files in this repository used to be part of my main configuration repository
[neko-config](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config) which contained everything
from skins to configurations files over to scripts. It has since been split off
into this separate repository which was started from scratch. This means that
for any previous commits made to the files in this repository before November
2017 you should have a look at the original repository over at
[neko-config-origin](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config-origin).
